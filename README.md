# GoIT PyCore Homework 03 Andrii Nazarenko

This repository contains four small Python scripts that demonstrate working with dates, random numbers, string normalization, and upcoming birthdays.

## Contents

- task-1.py: Calculate days between today and a target date.
- task-2.py: Generate a sorted list of unique lottery numbers with input validation.
- task-3.py: Normalize Ukrainian phone numbers to the +380 format.
- task-4.py: Build a list of upcoming birthdays and shift weekend dates to Monday.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (type hints use the PEP 604 union syntax).

## Run

From the project root:

```bash
python3 task-1.py
python3 task-2.py
python3 task-3.py
python3 task-4.py
```

## Notes

- Each script includes a small demo call at the bottom so you can run it directly.
